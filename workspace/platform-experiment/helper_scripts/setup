# This script is for developer workstations

# The intention is to have a script that can run with 
#    curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlibraryenvironment/platform-ill/master/helper_scripts/setup" | bash
# Which will configure a ux env
# 

# Make a directory for us to work inside - this is our workspace
mkdir ill_ui
cd ill_ui

# Copy the workspace package.json
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openlibraryenvironment/platform-ill/master/helper_scripts/package.json
